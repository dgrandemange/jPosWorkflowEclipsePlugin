=Primary needs=
In [http://www.jpos.org/ jPos], the transaction manager component  takes care of ''driving'' the transaction. To do so,  it relies on smaller units called participants. Participants are components through which the transaction flow may pass. Thus, the jPos transaction manager implementation design enhances code reuse and componentization. The transaction manager provides also some routing functionalities thanks to the ''org.jpos.transaction.GroupSelector''  interface.
Transaction manager is configured via a dedicated XML configuration.
See [http://www.jpos.org/products/proguide jPOS programmer's guide] §10 for more details.

The way a transaction is processed may vary, depending on many criteria.
For instance, the transaction type (activation, payment, cancellation ...) may change the way the transaction should be processed. Also, further in the processing, you may have to choose between different processing paths depending on many criteria : card's validity check result, acquirer response (acceptation, reject), ...

When wondering how to efficiently work on transaction manager configuration, and thinking about a process allowing to work incrementally on it so that it can easily be communicated to other people (maybe more business oriented people), one can not simply answer : edit transaction manager's XML configuration and it's done.

Having a graphical view would be much more talkative. Besides, a graphical representation (say a diagram state representation for instance) is easier to communicate to non developer people. Editing a workflow in an UML editor is a solution, but edition work needs to be done twice. And what if the workflow often changes ? This is not a very responsive process, with  the risk to loose informations. Eventually, it would be nice if we were able to generate a graphical view on the fly (and at will) straight from the XML transaction manager configuration itself.

Thinking of a graphical representation as a state diagram along its ''states'' and ''transitions'', there would be the transaction participants as ''states'' . But what about ''transitions''? Nothing in a transaction manager configuration formally identifies transitions between a participant and a group. But, taking a further look at §10.8 of jPOS programmer's guide, the configuration sample clearly shows that some properties are used for this purpose and hold a ''transition'' function.  In this sample, we can see properties which gives a list of groups to pass through, depending on the message type (0100, 0200,...). Obviously, theses properties can be used as transitions.

<pre>
     ...
     
     <participant class="org.jpos.my.Switch" logger="Q2">
     	< !--
     		If MTI is 0100, route to the following participants groups : 
     		- Authorization,
     		- Response,
     		- Log
     	-- >
     	<property name="0100" value="Authorization Response Log" />
     	
     	< !--
     		If MTI is 0200, route to the following participants groups : 
     		- Financial,
     		- Response,
     		- Log
     	-- >
     	<property name="0200" value="Financial Response Log" />
     
     	<property name="0220" value="Notification Response Log" />

=The jPos Workflow Eclipse plugin=
Keeping all of this in mind, a specific Eclipse plugin has been written which at this point provides  :
* conversion of a transaction manager configuration into a directed graph model,
* reduction of the previously generated directed graph,
* graphical view of the reduced graph in a dedicated Eclipse editor,
* image export of Eclipse view (JPG, PNG), 
* GraphViz format export (DOT) for enhanced rendering

Resulting design constraints are :
* keep the transaction participants as atomic as possible, 
* clearly identify transitions properties. In order for the plugin to work, those properties should be formally marked with a special attribute named ''selectCriterion'' , whose value should briefly describe the transition,
* avoid circular references

After adapting the previous transaction manager configuration excerpt to suit these constraints, we obtain the following configuration :

<u>File /deploy/20_txnmgr.xml</u>
<pre>
<!DOCTYPE SYSTEM [
 <!ENTITY Financial      SYSTEM "Financial.inc">
]> 

<txnmgr name="kdoTxn" logger="Q2"	class="org.jpos.transaction.TransactionManager">

	<participant class="org.jpos.my.Switch" logger="Q2">		
		<property name="0200" value="Financial Response Log" selectCriterion="incoming message 0200" />				
		<property name="0100" value="Authorization Response Log" selectCriterion="incoming message 0100" />
		<property name="0220" value="Notification Response Log" selectCriterion="incoming message 0220" />

		<property name="0500" value="BatchManagement Response Log" selectCriterion="incoming message 0500" />
		<property name="0800" value="NetworkManagement Response Log" selectCriterion="incoming message 0800" />
	</participant>
	
	&Financial;
	
	<!-- TODO : complete configuration at will -->
	
</txnmgr>
</pre>

<u>File /deploy/Financial.inc</u>
<pre>
	<group name="Financial">
		<participant class="org.jpos.jposext.jposworkflow.sample.participant.CheckRequiredFields">
			<property name="fields" value="0,3,4,17,49,32,41,43,37,PAN,AMOUNT" />

			<property name="ok" value="Financial_Suite1" selectCriterion="checked" />

	</group>
</pre>

After right-clicking configuration file ''20_txnmgr.xml'' in the Eclipse Package Explorer view, menu items ''jPos Workflow -> view ...'' should show up. 

Left-clicking one menu item should open a jPos Workflow view with a graphical representation of the selected configuration :
[[https://github.com/dgrandemange/jPosWorkflowEclipsePlugin/raw/master/wikidoc/workflowplugin_dummy.jpg|align=center]]

About this view : 
* if somewhere in the transaction manager configuration, a non yet declared participant/group is referenced, its icon shows up in red color, 
* transition informations can be seen by mouse over on ''information'' icons; if you have use context management annotations on your participant classes, thse informations also show up,
* double-clicking on a participant node may open the Java source of the associated participant class (provided it exists in your project),
* right clicking on jPos Workflow view, you may be able to export the graph as a DOT file (GraphViz format).

==GraphViz DOT export==
As the number of nodes and transitions may grow quickly, the Eclipse GEF graph layout at some point may become hardly readable; consider then using the DOT export function for a further GraphViz rendering.

Here is the generated DOT source after such export : 
<pre>
<nowiki>digraph "JPos Workflow Eclipse Plugin DOT Export" {</nowiki>

=Context management informations=
If your participant classes use [https://github.com/dgrandemange/context-mgmt-annotation context management annotations], the plugin detects it and extract informations from your annotated participants.

==About context management annotations==
<p>These annotations are intented to be used on participant classes (implementing jPos TransactionParticipant or GroupSelector interfaces). In a few words, these annotations are a way to explicitly declare which context attributes a participant may update while being processed.</p>

===Using annotations in participant : typical usage===

<u>Sample participant class ''CheckRequiredFields'' :</u>
<pre>
package org.jpos.jposext.jposworkflow.sample.participant;

import org.jpos.jposext.ctxmgmt.annotation.UpdateContextRule;
import org.jpos.jposext.ctxmgmt.annotation.UpdateContextRules;
import org.jpos.jposext.jposworkflow.sample.ICtxAttr;

@UpdateContextRules({
		@UpdateContextRule(attrNames = ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR0),
		@UpdateContextRule(id = CheckRequiredFields.TRANSITION__CHECKED_OK, attrNames = {ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR1, ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR2, ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR3 }),
		@UpdateContextRule(id = CheckRequiredFields.TRANSITION__CHECKED_KO, attrNames = {ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR4, ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR5 }) })
public class CheckRequiredFields extends AbstractGroupSelectorParticipant {

	public static final String TRANSITION__CHECKED_KO = "nok";
	public static final String TRANSITION__CHECKED_OK = "ok";

	/*
	 * (non-Javadoc)
	 * 
	 * @see org.jpos.jposext.jposworkflow.sample.participant.
	 * AbstractGroupSelectorParticipant#prepare(long)
	 */
	public int prepare(long id) {

		// always add attribute REQUIREDFLD_ATTR0 to context
		ctxPutForId(UpdateContextRule.DEFAULT_ID, "value0");

		// NB : method ctxPutForId() should be inherited from parent class
		// AbstractGroupSelectorParticipant
		// and knows how to update current transaction context using current
		// class @UpdateContextRules annotation

		return PREPARED | NO_JOIN;
	}

	/*
	 * (non-Javadoc)
	 * 
	 * @see org.jpos.jposext.jposworkflow.sample.participant.
	 * AbstractGroupSelectorParticipant#select(long)
	 */
	public String select(long id) {
		String transitionId;
		boolean checked = false;
		// do checks here ...

		if (checked) {
			// Fields checked
			transitionId = TRANSITION__CHECKED_OK;

			// Update context according to @UpdateContextRule of id
			// 'CHECKED_OK', passing respective attribute values as arguments
			ctxPutForId(transitionId, "attr1value", "attr2value", "attr3value");
		} else {
			transitionId = TRANSITION__CHECKED_KO;

			// Update context according to @UpdateContextRule of id
			// 'CHECKED_KO', passing respective attribute values as arguments
			ctxPutForId(transitionId, "attr4value", "attr5value");
		}

		// Looking in current participant configuration for next
		// participants/groups
		return getConfig().get(transitionId);
	}

}
</pre>
Note : context attribute names are externalized in a dedicated interface ''ICtxAttr''.

<u>Interface ''ICtxAttr'' :</u>
<pre>
package org.jpos.jposext.jposworkflow.sample;

public interface ICtxAttr {
	
	public static final String REQUIREDFLD_ATTR0 = "requiredfld.attr0";
	public static final String REQUIREDFLD_ATTR1 = "requiredfld.attr1";
	public static final String REQUIREDFLD_ATTR2 = "requiredfld.attr2";
	public static final String REQUIREDFLD_ATTR3 = "requiredfld.attr3";
	public static final String REQUIREDFLD_ATTR4 = "requiredfld.attr4";
	public static final String REQUIREDFLD_ATTR5 = "requiredfld.attr5";
	
	public static final String CURRENCY_ATTR0 = "currency.attr0";
	public static final String CURRENCY_ATTR1 = "currency.attr1";
	public static final String CURRENCY_ATTR2 = "currency.attr2";
	public static final String CURRENCY_ATTR3 = "currency.attr3";
	public static final String CURRENCY_ATTR4 = "currency.attr4";
	public static final String CURRENCY_ATTR5 = "currency.attr5";
}
</pre>

The sample participant above is of type GroupSelector ant its context management annotations specifie that :
# participant processing should always end with and attribute <code>ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR0</code> added to the context,
# in case check is ok <code>id = CheckRequiredFields.TRANSITION__CHECKED_OK</code>, participant processing should also add attributes <code>ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR1, ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR2, ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR3</code> to the context,
# in case check is ko <code>id = CheckRequiredFields.TRANSITION__CHECKED_KO</code>, participant processing should also add attributes <code>ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR1, ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR2, ICtxAttr.REQUIREDFLD_ATTR3</code> to the context, 

===Using context management annotations to enforce design rules ===
<p>Well it's only about annotations, and it does not ensure at all that the developper effectively update the context accordingly to the rules wrapped in these annotations. These are merely specifications, nothing else.</p>

<p>Therefore, it may be a good idea to let the participant delegate the context management to a service or something that relies on the context management annotations (through reflection) to do this job, and restrict direct access to the transaction context object from the participant's methods.</p>

<p>In the sample participant above, we have chosen to make it inherit an abstract class AbstractGroupSelectorParticipant that cares about this concern. The ''prepare()'' and ''select()'' methods don't provide the transaction context anymore. A single method <code>void ctxPutForId(String transitionId, Object...attributesValues)</code> is available to update the context.</p>

<p>More over, having a dedicated annotation processor that makes some various consistency checks at compilation time may also reveal very useful.</p>

==Plugin use of context management annotations==
===Participant node===
<p>Mousing over a simple TransactionParticipant node, it shows the list of context attributes that are updated by the participant.</p>
<p>Dealing with a GroupSelector, depending on the outcome transition, extra context attributes may be updated. Mousing over such node, it shows the list of context attributes indexed by outcomed transition.</p>

<u>Mousing over the '''CheckRequiredFields''' participant node :</u>
[[https://github.com/dgrandemange/jPosWorkflowEclipsePlugin/raw/master/wikidoc/workflowplugin_ctxinfo_participant.jpg|align=center]]

===Transition edge===
<p>Mousing over a transition edge shows up every attributes that are guaranteed to be present in the context at this point of the workflow.</p>

<u>Mousing over the transition '''ok''' binding source node '''CheckRequiredFields''' to target node '''CheckCurrency''' :</u>
[[https://github.com/dgrandemange/jPosWorkflowEclipsePlugin/raw/master/wikidoc/workflowplugin_ctxinfo_transition_guaranteed.jpg|align=center]]

<p>Now, as the graph is reduced (common branches of the original graph tree are merged as much as possible), looking to the end of the workflow of our switch transaction manager configuration above, we can see just one ''Response'' participant with a transition to one ''Log'' participant. That's because this part is common to every processing (athorization, notification, finanacial, reversal, ...). Looking back at the beginning of the workflow, the ''authorization'' processing may put some particular attributes in the context whereas the ''notification'' processing may put some others. And maybe they also both share some commons attributes in the process.</p>
<p>Mousing over the late transition of the workflow, plugin shows not only the common attributes guaranteed to be set in the context, but also the ones that may be set somewhere in the parent branches. Special icons distinguish guaranteed attributes from non-guaranteed ones.</p>

<u>Mousing over the default transition binding source node '''Response''' to target node '''Log''' :</u>
[[https://github.com/dgrandemange/jPosWorkflowEclipsePlugin/raw/master/wikidoc/workflowplugin_ctxinfo_transition_non_guaranteed.jpg|align=center]]

This may reveal helpful at some point of the workflow, when one of your participant need to get one attribute from the context, and you want make sure this attribute is present at that point.

=Subflows=
==What for ?==
===jPos user "divide to rule" approach===
<p>When jPos transaction manager configuration is growing, jPos users naturally tend to extract participants into external entities. From a user point of view, doing so eases the configuration reading and maintenance.</p>

===jPos worflow plugin "divide to rule" approach===
<p>When a jPos transaction manager configuration becomes consequent and the number of different possible paths is exponentially growing, the plugin execution time may increase, and eventually becomes unacceptable.</p>

<p>It then becomes necessary to go for a "divide to rule" approach and identify in this big/all-mixed-up configuration if some parts could be identified as ''subflows'' and extracted into external entities.</p>

<p>The plugin approach of a ''subflow'' is :
*a ''subflow'' should be seen as a set of participant groups, with one group identified as the subflow entry point, 
*when the ''subflow'' job is done, it simply stops, implicitely giving the control back to its parent flow,
*a ''subflow'' shouldn't reference a group of its parent flow; still, it may at some point give the control to another subflow by reference this latter's entrypoint group.</p>

====Implicitely giving the control back====
Well, a straight strategy is : always get in your subflow a dedicated group (name it <your-subflow-name>EndPoint) that wraps a generic TransactionParticipant (not GroupSelector) that does nothing, and always redirect to it when your subflow job is done.

In case you have a GroupSelector with one choice that should do nothing bu return to the parent flow, just set let this tranistion value empty. Here is an example with group <code>Financial_Suite1</code> and its transition <code>nok</code> :

<pre>
	<group name="Financial_Suite1">
		<participant class="org.jpos.jposext.jposworkflow.sample.participant.CheckCurrency">
			<property name="ok" value="Financial_Suite2" selectCriterion="checked" />
			<property name="nok" value="" selectCriterion="unchecked" />
		</participant>
	</group>
</pre>

==Eclipse plugin implementation==
The plugin provides now two modes.

===The subflow mode===
<p>When choosing the <code>view graph (entity refs as subflows)</code> menu item, the plugin will parse the transaction manager configuration and convert it into a(some) graph(s), considering all external entity references as subflows, and therefore converting them in independent (well not that much independent really) graphs. Computations times will significantly improves.</p>

<p>When the main graph is showed in Eclipse editor, clicking on any nodes referencing a subflow will open a further Eclipse editor in wich the associated subflow graph will be shown. And so on ... You can then navigate from parents to childs flows.</p>

<p>Note that on a subflow opening, context management informations available at this particular point are inherited by the subflow graph.</p>

===The good old full-expanded mode===
<p>When choosing the <code>view graph (expanded)</code> menu item, external entity references will be expanded when parsing the transaction manager configuration. Therefore no subflows will be identified, graph should show up in one Eclipse editor only.</p>
